# üöó Car Insurance Claims - Process Mining & Anomaly Detection

## Overview  
This repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** that explores an event log dataset for **car insurance claims**. The dataset is designed for **process mining**, enabling analysis of bottlenecks, automation opportunities, conformance issues, reworks, and potential fraud detection.  

The primary focus of my analysis is **anomaly detection** across different attributes of the claims process.

## Dataset Description  
The dataset represents the standard **car insurance claims process**, which follows this workflow:  

### **Standard Process Flow:**  
> **First Notification of Loss (FNOL)** ‚Üí **Assign Claim** ‚Üí **Claim Decision** ‚Üí **Set Reserve** ‚Üí **Payment Sent** ‚Üí **Close Claim**  

### **Attributes:**  
- `case ID` ‚Üí Unique identifier for each claim  
- `activity name` ‚Üí Stage in the claims process  
- `timestamp` ‚Üí Time of event occurrence  
- `claimant name` ‚Üí Name of the person filing the claim  
- `agent name` ‚Üí Agent handling the claim  
- `adjuster name` ‚Üí Adjuster responsible for assessing the claim  
- `claim amount` ‚Üí Amount requested in the claim  
- `claimant age` ‚Üí Age of the claimant  
- `type of policy` ‚Üí Insurance policy type (e.g., Collision, Comprehensive, Liability)  
- `car make` ‚Üí Manufacturer of the insured vehicle  
- `car model` ‚Üí Model of the insured vehicle  
- `car year` ‚Üí Year of manufacture of the insured vehicle  
- `date and time of the accident` ‚Üí When the accident occurred  
- `type of accident` ‚Üí Nature of the accident (e.g., Rear-end, Side-impact, Head-on)  
- `user type` ‚Üí Whether the claim was processed by a human or an automated system (RPA)

## Notebook Structure  

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning**  
- Handling missing values  
- Formatting timestamps and sorting events  
- Removing duplicates and inconsistencies  

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Understanding the distribution of claims  
- Identifying trends and seasonality  
- Visualizing claim amounts and processing times  
- Analyzing the lifecycle of claims  

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Anomaly Detection**  
- **Statistical Methods:** Z-Score, IQR  
- **Clustering:** K-Means, DBSCAN  
- **Machine Learning:** One-Class SVM  
- **Deep Learning:** Autoencoders  
- **Process Flow Analysis:** Checking if events follow the correct sequence  

#### **Scenarios Considered for Anomalies:**  
- **Unusual claim amounts** _(depends on car year & accident type)_  
- **Duplicate or multiple claims by the same claimant**  
- **Delays between process stages**  
- **Unusual age patterns among claimants**  
- **Adjusters with abnormal damage assessments**  
- **Events that do not follow the expected process flow**  

### **Evaluation of Results**  
Identifying common anomalies across methods  
Comparing detection accuracy and effectiveness  
Visualizing flagged cases
